#  Diabetes Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)

This project is a Machine Learning model built using the **K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)** algorithm to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on certain medical attributes.  
It was developed as part of my machine learning practice using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Scikit-learn** in a **Jupyter Notebook**.

##  Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the Outcome (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-Diabetic) based on patient health data such as glucose level, BMI, age, etc.  
The project involves:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Splitting data into training and testing sets  
- Feature scaling using **StandardScaler**    
- Training a **KNN classifier**  
- Evaluating model accuracy  

##  Algorithm Used
**K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)** is a simple and powerful classification algorithm that:
- Classifies data based on the majority vote of its *k* nearest neighbours.
- Works best when data is properly scaled.
  
##  Technologies & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – for numerical computations  
- **Scikit-learn** – for model building and evaluation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – for visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for experimentation
